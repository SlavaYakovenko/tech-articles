# AI Integration Workflow Analysis Template

## Current State Assessment

### Tools Currently Using AI
- [ ] IDE (Copilot, CodeWhisperer, etc.)
- [ ] Documentation (AI writing assistants)
- [ ] Code Review (AI-powered analysis)
- [ ] Testing (AI test generation)
- [ ] Project Management (AI in JIRA/ClickUp)

### Manual Processes
- [ ] Requirements analysis
- [ ] Context switching between tools
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Git operations
- [ ] Knowledge transfer

### Pain Points
1. **Context Loss**: Describe where you lose context when switching tools
2. **Manual Copy-Paste**: List repetitive information transfer tasks
3. **Tool Isolation**: Identify disconnected AI tools
4. **Process Bottlenecks**: Note where AI could help but doesn't

## Target State Design

### Integration Opportunities
- Requirements → Code generation
- Code changes → Documentation updates
- JIRA tickets → Development context
- Git operations → Project management updates

### Success Metrics
- Time saved on context switching
- Reduction in manual information transfer
- Improved documentation accuracy
- Faster development cycles
